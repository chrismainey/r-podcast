### Other notes

* I wore multiple hats: My "industry/work" hat, my "podcaster" hat, and my "ambassador for R Weekly" hat.  I was humbled to have this opportunity
* simultaneously excited and exhausted
* Much bigger than last year
* Huge interest in communicating results interactively (Carson Sievert's talk had standing room only)
* __IDEA__: Try to add a page with an HTML widget of showing pictures I took during the conference.  Use slickR package as htmlwidget within widgetframe package widget and put pictures in imgur rstudio conf 2018 album.  See <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/html-widgets.html> and <https://rawgit.com/bhaskarvk/widgetframe/examples/blogdown/public/index.html>
* Review the pics I took during presentations: What were the aha moments
* Key note Di Cook: An interesting blend of the newer tidyverse principles with what can be quite complicated statistical inference methods (and she used xarangin!)
* Shiny async processes: This is a real thing and very important
* Key note tensorflow: Real-time visualizion of model performance, practical explanation of deep learning, balanced the benefits and tradeoffs
* Marco talk: Empowering users with DataCamp
* Tidycf talk
* Extending tidyverse training course: Everything is a syntax tree (talk about the lobstr package for visualizing those), How hadley could quickly adapt to the questions asked and modify his slides so quickly in real time, little RStudio tricks and keyboard shortcuts (multiple cursor thing)
* Mayo clinic talk about migrating from SAS to R (not a simple process but they took things step by step)
* Meeting such a wide variety of R users, and meeting those within similar industries
