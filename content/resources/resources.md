This page lists resources that I have found very helpful in learning R:

Official R Resources
--------------------

-   [www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org/): The R Project home
    page.  You will find official documentation, links to download all
    versions of R, information about the R contributors and foundation,
    and much more.
-   [The R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/index.html): The
    refereed journal with research articles introducing new R packages,
    updates on news and events, and textbook reviews.
-   [www.bioconductor.org](http://www.bioconductor.org/): The home site
    for the Bioconductor suite of packages aimed at bioinformatics.

Forums and Mailing Lists
------------------------

-   The official R mailing lists:
    [R-announce](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.announce),
    [R-packages](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.packages),
    [R-help](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.general), and
    [R-devel](http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.devel).  There are
    also many other special interest group (SIG) mailing lists as well.
-   [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): An
    innovative Q&A style forum for programming questions.  You can find
    questions related to R by putting the tag \[r\] at the end of a
    search query.
-   [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/): Another Q&A
    style forum much like Stack Overflow for statisticians, data
    analysts, data miners, and data visualization experts.  Many
    questions about R and other statistical packages appear here.

Online References and Tutorials
-------------------------------

-   [Rseek](http://www.rseek.org/): The customized search engine created
    by Sasha Goodman designed specifically for R related queries.  There
    is also funcionality for adding Rseek to the available search
    engines inside Firefox and Internet Explorer.
-   [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net): Robert Kabacoff's excellent
    overview of how to accomplish tasks like importing and managing
    data, performing basic and some advanced statistical routines, and
    how to create basic plots within R.  I find myself accessing this
    site anytime I need a quick refresher of a concept.
-   [R Cookbook](http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/FrontPage): A
    wiki-style tutorial created by Winston Chang with some excellent
    examples for manipulating data, statistical analyses, and
    producing graphics.
-   [R Programming](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming): A
    wikibook of many R topics organized by tasks.  Best of all, anyone
    can contribute their knowledge of R to this wikibook.
-   [r4stats.com](http://r4stats.com/): Robert Muenchen's companion
    reference site to his excellent "R for SAS and SPSS Users" textbook.
     This site contains example programs for data management, graphics,
    statistics, and basic R programming among others.  Also contains a
    nice table showing which SAS, SPSS, and R packages can be used to
    accomplish a variety of statistical analyses.

Recommended Textbooks
---------------------

-   [R Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do) by
    Paul Teetor: A well-written example (recipe) based guide through a
    wide selection of topics that belongs on any R user's bookshelf.
-   [The Art of R
    Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593273842.do) by
    Norman Matloff: An excellent survey of R that is easily accessible
    to those with more of a computer science background, and not
    just statistics. If you are looking to improve the way you develop R
    scripts, this is a must-have in my opinion!
-   [R for SAS and SPSS Users](http://www.rforsasandspssusers.com/) by
    Robert Muenchen: This is arguably the best textbook for new users of
    R who have experience using SAS or SPSS.  If you want a preview of
    the text, Robert has a free
    [PDF](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyNHN0YXRpc3RpY3N8Z3g6MWNmZDQ4ZjcwODY2Y2I0Yw)
    version from his earlier notes on using R.
-   [ggplot2 - Elegant Graphics for Data
    Analysis](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book/) by Hadley Wickham: If you
    want to truly master creating graphics using the ggplot2 package,
    this reference from the package's author tells you how to master the
    unique language and the many configurations available for
    ggplot2 graphics.
