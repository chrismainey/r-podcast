Description = "In episode 20 I'm happy to bring you more great interviews with members of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) from [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)!  I had the pleasure of chatting with software engineer [Javier Luraschi](https://github.com/rstudio/) to discuss [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and the new [sparklyr](http://spark.rstudio.com/index.html) package that allows R users to connect directly to a Spark cluster for high-performance data analyses.  In addition you will hear from RStudio's master instructor [Garret Grolemund](http://twitter.com/RStudio) to get his recommendations for teaching R and the highly-acclaimed [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book.  All of this plus a package pick that could enable me to use R in my podcast workflow in episode 20 of the R-Podcast!"
