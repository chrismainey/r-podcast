Description = "The R-Podcast concludes its coverage of [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) by chatting with [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/board.html) member and [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org/) author [Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/)!  We cover a variety of topics including the state of Rcpp, how the integration of Rcpp in RStudio came about, and his perspective on Linux in the R community.  Plus a new batch of listener feedback and a package pick that gives your shiny apps and rmarkdown reports a little more bootstrap polish.  Enjoy episode 21 of the R-Podcast!"
