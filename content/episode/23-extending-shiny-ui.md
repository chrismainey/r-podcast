Description: "In this episode: The R-Podcast site is now powered by `blogdown`!.  I give a tour of the new site and outline my next steps to make the production pipeline even more powered by R.  Plus I present a tutorial on enhancing the user interfaces of `shiny` applications that pay off for you and your app viewers, with a video version available on the new R-Podcast [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheRPodcast).  We round things off with a recap of the ROpenSci Unconference and discuss more listener feedback.  I hope you enjoy episode 23 of the R-Podcast!"
